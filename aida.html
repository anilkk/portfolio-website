        <p>As part of my CareerFoundry Certified UX Designer intensive course I designed Aida - a healthcare and wellness app native for iOS. I was tasked to create an expert app that enables users to chat with experts in any field, and from that
          Aida was born.</p>
        <h3>The product</h3>
        <p>The goal of Aida is to make healthcare more convenient and comfortable for women. On Aida users can connect through video calls or chat with female practitioners in various healthcare fields, from GPs to gynecologists and ayurveda
          therapists to wellness coaches. </p>
        <h3>Target audience and the challenge it solves</h3>
        <p>Aida is for all women that are looking for a convenient way to take care of their health and wellness. For the modern, busy woman, Aida provides a holistic healthcare solution. Users can now forget about long waits at doctor's offices or
          seeing practitioners that don't listen to them - on Aida all practitioners treat patients with respect, understanding and a holistic approach.</p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>I worked as a solo designer on this project. I was responsible for all steps throughout the process, all the way from ideation to the final prototype.</p>

        <h3>My design process</h3>
        <p>My design process starting from defining the problem in November 2019 to having a refined and tested prototype in April 2020.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
        <p>Even though there is no lack of doctors' offices and practitioners available, there are not many convenient and holistic solutions out there for taking care of one's health and wellness. Most people take care of their health sporadically
          and without putting too much thought into it - when they get sick they find a doctor that is conveniently located or that their friends or family recommend. However, finding this doctor can be time-consuming and tricky, and sometimes you
          might end up with a doctor that just doesn't get you.</p>
        <p>This can be especially true for women. Women can feel uncomfortable turning to unfamiliar doctors with their most intimate issues and questions.</p>
        <p>From this problem statement the initial thought of Aida emerged..</p>

            <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
            <p>To get started, I had to get to know the market and the other players out there. I noticed that there are a few popular apps that connect users with doctors, and I chose two of them for a SWOT analysis. On the left is the analysis I
              did for two competitors - KRY and Maven Clinic. </p>
            <p>KRY is a Swedish company that in recent years has expanded to other European countries. Maven Clinic is an American company.</p>
            <p>From the competitive analysis I discovered that there is indeed a need on the market for a well-functioning, holistic healthcare and wellness app specifically aimed for women..</p>

                interviews</b> to get an understanding both on the width and depth.</p>
            <p>I wanted to find out what the users biggest needs, wishes and challenges are when it comes to taking care of their health. After the user interviews, I summarized all the findings in affinity maps.</p>

              <p>After the user research it was apparent for me that users have some frustrations and wishes when it comes to their healthcare at the moment, and that there is a need on the market for a more holistic healthcare solution . The
                solution should offer both convenience and quickness in a personalized way. I also got some ideas about what would be important features to include in the app, for instance reviews and bios for each practitioner. </p>

              <p>I started the designing process by sketching out ideas with pen and paper. I sketched wireframes for the key functionalities and screens that were presented in the user flows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Find and message a practitioner</li>
                <li>Go to scheduled call & book the next call</li>
                <li>Leave a review for a practitioner</li>
              </ol>
              <p>From the sketches, the screens slowly started to take shape. After sketching, I moved to creating mid-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq and thereafter in Adobe XD.</p>

                <p>I chose a bottom tab bar as navigation. The navigation includes four tabs: Home, Find care, Messages and My profile. The sitemap transformed in quite a straightforward way to the navigation. The five main categories from the
                  sitemap were incorporated in the navigation. In addition to these, "Messages" was included in the navigation. This enables the user to easily and quickly navigate to all important areas of the app.</p>

                  <p>This flow was designed with the <b>persona Louise</b> in mind. I wanted the flow to be as uncomplicated and quick as possible. When a user has a question to ask on-the-go, it is important that they are able to easily navigate to
                    the messaging function. Therefore I chose to present the healthcare fields first on the main "Find care" screen. From there the user can navigate to the desired field, filter practitioners, continue to the profile and choose to
                    message the practitioner.</p>

                    basis. The flow starts with a notification about the upcoming call and after the call the user is presented with the option to book a new call.</p>

              <h3>User tests</h3>
              <p>Finally it was time to test my prototype with real users. The goal of the user tests was to evaluate the key functionalities and features of the app and observe how users interact with the app. I wanted to see what users find
                challenging with the app in order to further improve the design. The tests took in average 30 minutes. I specified <b>five test objectives</b> based on the key functionalities. I created direct as well as scenario questions in order
                to test them. I wanted to see for instance whether users knew where to navigate in order to leave a review. It was very exciting to see how users interacted with the first prototype!</p>

                <p>I organized all my findings first in affinity maps. Thereafter I summarized the 30 key findings from the tests in a Rainbow spreadsheet. I used Jakob Nielsen's scale from 1 to 5 to evaluate the severity of each error or improvement
                  idea.</p>

              <h3>From feedback & own learnings to new improved iterations</h3>
              <p>Most participants completed the five tasks quite easily and effortlessly, and no major usability errors were discovered. The tests revealed things that the participants, however, felt a bit hesitant or confused about. Participants
                also came with good improvement ideas and suggestions.</p>
              <p>Based on the user feedback and observations, a few bigger improvements were made. Users had for instance felt confused about the payment structure on the app. These issues were evaluated as critical and improved immediately.</p>
              <p>After the user tests, further iterations were made before the final mockups were reached. I also invited fellow students to review my work and give feedback.</p>

                <p>A couple of users wished to be able to filter also by price and first availability. These options were added as filters and also as sorting options. The amount of matching practitioners was also added to the button. In the final
                  design, the sorting has been separated from the filtering to make it easier for users to access it.</p>

                  to have a clear and easy way of presenting reviews.</p>

                <p>In the final design, the filter has been moved down on the screen and the sort function is located on the opposite side of it. There they are easily visible to the user. In the user tests a few users didn't see the filter option
                  when it was located in the top right corner.</p>

                  message was shown that told them to add their payment information before proceeding. This was confusing for them.</p>
                <p>The user flow was changed so that it follows a step-by-step flow now. In the new design, the user picks first the date and time and then clicks "Continue" which takes them to the payment step. This is more clear and with the added
                  progress indicator the user will also know where in the flow they are.</p>

                <p>In the usability test a few participants stated that for them the focus of the app felt a bit unclear on the home screen and they weren't sure how to proceed in order to connect with someone.</p>
                <p>A few users said that the notification on the top of the screen (above the name) felt a bit too pushy and the search field in the middle felt out of place.</p>
                <p>I did many iterations of the home screen before I landed on the final mockup.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I ended up placing the search field on top of the screen as now it's equally located on both the home screen and the "Search" screen. This way users find it in the same place across screens. </li>
                  <li>The call reminder was placed under the name as there it's more connected to the name and creates a small personalized section on the home screen.</li>
